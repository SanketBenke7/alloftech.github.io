Lets first understand how python program is executed.

| *CPython Implementation* |

 - First you write your python code in file let call that file foo.py.
 - You run python command
   > python foo.py

 - Of course computer doesn't understand this high level language. Computer works only on machine languages. To convert your code to machine language, python perform following steps:

    - Python code gets compiled to bytecode and gives .pyc file, in our case foo.pyc
    - This .pyc file then gets interpreted to machine language in PVM(Python Virtual Machine) and finally you get your output

 - This process of implementation is CPython.

 ## CPython:

 - CPython is the default byte-code interpreter of Python, which is written in C and python.
 - When you install python from https://www.python.org/, default iterpreter is CPython.
 - CPython basically convert your code to bytecode first and then interpreted this bytecode to machine language and gives you output.
 - CPython is slow

 ## PyPy:

 - As we now know, CPython is slow, to fill this gap, PyPy is used.
 - PyPy is written in RPython(Restricted Python - a subset of python.)
 - But what makes PyPy fast? It is JIT Compiler.
 - PyPy uses JIT or Just-in-Time compilation approach to compile the source code into native machine code instead of bytecode. Thereby making the code to run faster.
 - PyPy is a compiler and CPython is interpreter.
 - PyPy workd faster for only pure python code.
 - So the case where PyPy works best is when executing long-running programs where a significant fraction of the time is spent executing Python code.

 - Features of PyPy:
   - Speed (4.4 times faster than CPython on an average.)
   - Memory usage
   - Stackless

 - Drawbacks of PyPy:
   - if your code doesn't run for at least a few seconds, then the JIT compiler won't have enough time to warm up.
   - If all the time is spent in run-time libraries (i.e. in C functions), and not actually running Python code, the JIT compiler will not help.
   - Not suitable for data science libraries as it contains C functions and not pure python code.


## Installation of PyPy3:

- Ubuntu:

> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pypy/ppa

> sudo apt update

> sudo apt install pypy3

- Mac:

> brew install pypy3

- Windows:

> Download Windows Binary file from https://www.pypy.org/download.html

## Installation of Pip:

 - Download the latest version of get-pip.py from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/.
 - go to the folder where you download get-pip and run following cmd:
 > pypy get-pip.py


 Now lets compare time taken by CPython vs PyPy

 |![PyPy](/assets/images/2022-10-08-00-pypy3-time-taken.png) |
 |:--:|
 | *PyPy* |


As we can see by above example, pypy took only 5 seconds to complete and cpython took 2 minutes and 20 seconds to complete.
So use pypy3 for pure python code and use CPython if you have libraries which are in C language.
