With support of huge number of libraries which enables provision for easy compatibility for any tool, **_Python_** has been one of the most used programming language for scripting. In this blog, we will look at how can we can easily increase the efficiency of our scripts multifold based on our usecase.

Lets first understand how python program is executed.

| *CPython Implementation* |

 - First you write your python code in file, lets call that file foo.py.
 - You run python below command
   > python foo.py

 - Of course computer doesn't understand this high level language. Computer works only on machine languages. To convert your code to machine language, python perform following steps:

    - Python code gets compiled to bytecode and gives .pyc file, in our case foo.pyc
    - This .pyc file then gets interpreted to machine language in PVM(Python Virtual Machine) and finally you get your output

 - This process of implementation is **CPython**.
 - **Python is a programming language and CPython is implementation of python.**

<br><br>
 ## CPython:

 - CPython is the default byte-code interpreter of Python, which is written in C.
 - When you install python from https://www.python.org/, default iterpreter is CPython.
 - **CPython basically convert your code to bytecode first and then interpreted this bytecode to machine language and gives you output.**
 - CPython is slow


<br><br>
 ## PyPy:

 - As we now know, CPython is slow, to fill this gap, PyPy is used.
 - PyPy is written in RPython(Restricted Python - a subset of python.)
 - But what makes PyPy fast? It is JIT Compiler.
 - **PyPy uses JIT or Just-in-Time compilation approach to compile the source code into native machine code instead of bytecode. Thereby making the code to run faster.**
 - PyPy is a compiler and CPython is interpreter.
 - PyPy workd faster for only pure python code.
 - So the case where PyPy works best is when executing long-running programs where a significant fraction of the time is spent executing Python code.

 - Features of PyPy:
   - Speed (4.4 times faster than CPython on an average.)
   - Memory usage
   - Stackless

 - Drawbacks of PyPy:
   - if your code doesn't run for at least a few seconds, then the JIT compiler won't have enough time to warm up.
   - If all the time is spent in run-time libraries (i.e. in C functions), and not actually running Python code, the JIT compiler will not help.
   - Not suitable for data science libraries as it contains C functions and not pure python code.

## Installation of PyPy3:

- Ubuntu:

  > sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pypy/ppa

  > sudo apt update

  > sudo apt install pypy3

- Mac:

  > brew install pypy3

- Windows:

  > Download Windows Binary file from https://www.pypy.org/download.html

<br>
## Installation of Pip:

 - Download the latest version of get-pip.py from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/.
 - go to the folder where you download get-pip and run following cmd:
   > pypy get-pip.py

## Running python code using pypy:

 - First write your python code.
 - then run following command instead of running > python3 <file_name.py>
   > pypy3 <file_name.py>

## Comparison between CPython and PyPy

 |![CPython](/assets/images/2022-10-08-00-python3-time-taken.png) |
 |:--:|
 | *time taken by CPython* |


 |![PyPy](/assets/images/2022-10-08-00-pypy3-time-taken.png) |
 |:--:|
 | *time taken by PyPy* |


As we can see by above example, PyPy took only 5 seconds to complete and CPython took 2 minutes and 20 seconds to complete.
So use PyPy for pure python code and use CPython if you have libraries which are in C and python language.
