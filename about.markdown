# Why, but Why this blog?

Hi everybody, my name is Ankur and I started web development quite recently, along with working as a DevOps Engineer since several years.

Since I have started working in web development, I have learned quite a bunch of useful things, and want to share it with the community,so I have decided to write them down in a blog, and make them available to everybody.

Also, anyone wanting to do the same can raise a PR to my repository following the Contribution guide on the repository. 

I hope you will enjoy it!
